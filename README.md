Module 2 Challenge - creating a menu for customers

Very thankful to have immense help from classmates Corey Holton, Michael Calabrese, and Phil Klimkewicz.  Corey walked us through much of the assignment on a couple of very long collaboration calls Sunday afternoon.  Though we all helped each other out, much of my code may be similar to Corey's due to his assistance.  Everyone's experience and input on those calls had a great impact.  Corey helped primarily with the order intake section and print sections.

The class itslef helped with the match case section.  Much of that code mirrors assignemnt number two from the activities for the 2.3 lesson.  This was a match case exercise that happened to employ the exact structure requested in the menu assignment.  The code is copied almost exactly since the structures were the same.

Joey Cheung, the Teacher's Assistant was a huge help as well.  I was very thankful for his patience and experience as he helped me walk through debugging two issues I'd encountered near the end of the assignemnt.  With is help, we were able to narrow down issues with formatting and misplaced code so that the final operation of the program ran as smoothly as intended.  This affected issues with proper printing of the Customer Order.  The Price and Quanity were printing with errors, and he helped me find the causes.  Joey also helped me make sure I was running my git push process correctly.

The teamwork in this course has been both encouraging and instructive.  Very thankful to have that and look forward to more as the course continues.
